# A collection of `.jazzignore` templates
Inspired by github/gitignore, this is a bunch of common adjustments to be made to a jazzignore if you are using RTC

Please use these and feel free to create pull requests if you use them.  I tried to keep a bunch that I thought 
I might use, but it's hardly a definitive list, nor well tested.  If you feel that your matches are better than 
the ones in here, please feel free to submit a pull request explaining why.
